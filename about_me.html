		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p>When people ask Robert where he is from, he never knows what to say. Robert was born just outside of Pittsburgh, PA on St. Patrick's Day of 1977. As a child he lived all over Western Pennsylvania. He then moved to North Carolina in the early 90's. He graduated high school in 1995 at Athens Drive High in Raleigh. After high school he ended up at Wake Tech Community College and NC State University. He did not last long in university as he just wasn't ready to buckle down for studies at the time. Robert then moved back to the Pittsburgh area where he ended up managing his uncle's bar. Funny thing - he went to bartending school after working at the bar and never bartended again. He then found himself working as a staff accountant for the next two years. In this time he also attended school to become a massage therapist. After finishing massage therapy school, he knew he didn't want to stay in Pittsburgh but wasn't sure where he would end up next. Well, he went back to Raleigh. He did't want to start working as a massage therapist there and found himself working at IBM as a temp in their recruiting department. After about 9 months at IBM, most of his department got laid off. He had no idea what he was going to do next and ended up delivering pizza to pay the bills. This is when an acquaintance of his was looking to move to Hollywood to become an actor and needed a roommate out in LA. He asked Robert and Robert said "Sure, why not? I've never been to California". Robert sold just about everything he had, packed up his Jeep left town on January 2nd, 2002. Him and his friend made it out of town just in time to beat a snowstorm. They arrived in Los Angeles forty hours later. After a couple months in CA, Robert found a job at a fancy new movie theatre in Hollywood working in the bar and cafe. He started two months before the theatre opened along with about 150 other people. He made many friends through that job that he still has today. After two years in the theatre he was ready for something new and wound up doing a variety of different jobs as a temp. This is when he landed a decent paying job in a film archive. He stayed with the company for eight years. In that time he moved from Hollywood to North Hollywood and Finally ended up in Venice Beach. Robert and Venice where made for each other. After taking on just about every role at his company with little room for advancement, he decided it was time to move on again. Of course, he wasn't sure what he would do next. He had a friend who owned his own Audio/Video installation business and was looking for help. For the next year and a half spent his days installing fancy entertainment systems in the homes of the rich and famous. The work though was just not consistent enough and it was time for him to move on again. He found himself living in the Florida Keys for six months where he became a Divemaster and found himself most days in the crystal blue tropical waters exploring shipwrecks and reefs. Robert had a plan to leave the Keys for a few months to save up some money to return to the Keys to buy a sailboat to live on. Before he got to work flipping a duplex in Pennsylvania he found himself on the road for about two months driving across the country to attend Burning Man and taking a trip to Alaska. He ended up saving the money to buy the boat and return to the tropical paradise to live and work but at the last minute decided to return to Los Angeles and Venice Beach where his heart was. He had a difficult time when he returned as rental market was soaring in price and the job he found just didn't pay enough to cover all of the bills. It was a pretty cool job though. He was working as a freight forwarder for a company that specialized in shipping high end cars around the world in shipping containers. Robert's team worked exclusively with Tesla shipping all of their international orders from the factory. After leaving this job, Robert found himself back in Raleigh to help out his aging grandparents. This is where he discovered his next opportunity learning to code as a web developer. Where he goes next is still unwritten.</p>
		<p>Other than scuba diving and traveling Robert has many interests. He has been into bicycles and motorcycles for as long as he can remember. He's a surfer and skater. He enjoys movies of all types. A movie has to be pretty bad for him not to get some sort of enjoyment out of it. He's constantly learning something new or new ways to do something he already knows. One of his favorite things is attending festivals especially if there is a chance to camp at the same time. He looks forward to exploring more of the world in the coming years.</p>
