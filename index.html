		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
      Hello! My name is Robert Cunningham. Some people call me Rob. Some people call me Bob. Maybe I should just go by Brob.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently searching for a junior front-end web developer position. I have been teaching myself web development for a the past year and look forward to finding a company to learn and grow with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have many years of professional experience. After leaving my job of eight years at Pro-Tek Vaults(at the time I was there it was a subsidiary of Kodak and called Pro-Tek Film Archives) in November 2012, I set out on a journey to find my next great career path. Not the best time to be leaving a good and stable career to venture into the unknown. Hindsight is 20/20, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      First up, I started working for a friend's company who needed some help. Audio/video installation to the stars. Before I go there, he and the guy I replaced actually tried shopping around a reality show based on their work. Working in hot attics and crawl spaces under mansions in Beverly Hills was not the direction I was looking to go on this journey of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next up, I find myself in the Florida Keys working in a small sign shop while I spend 6 months becoming a PADI Divemaster. Diving is amazing but for me I found that I'd rather dive recreationally than professionally. Being responsible for the well being and lives of others when you are 100 feet under the water wasn't something I wanted as part of my daily routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a couple months travelling after leaving the Keys. I racked up a lot of miles on the road and got to experience both Burning Man and Alaska in that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next 4 months are spent in the small college town of Indiana, PA where I helped renovate a duplex for college rentals. Daily trips to Lowes and dealing with contractors who had a questionable work ethic. Upon completing this project, I set off back for Los Angeles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once back in L.A., I found myself a job as a freight forwarder at CFR Rinkens. CFR is a company that specializes in placing high end vehicles into shipping containers and then shipping those off to all points of the globe. I landed on the team responsible for shipping Tesla autos from the factory in Fremont, CA to their international buyers. It may sound intersting but this job was kind of boring, quite stressful and highly underpaid. The only perk was a warehouse full of cool and amazing vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally getting to my current path of becoming a developer. I left CA and moved to NC to help out my aging grandparents who were having difficulty with the upkeep and maintenance of their duplex and property. After a few years of jobs that were not a good match for me, I started to learn to code. My first venture into coding was in 1997 when I took a web design class. There, I had my first taste of HTML. CSS did not even exist yet. Now it's been a year that I have really started to learn web development. I'm mostly self taught with the help of books and the internet. I did attend a coding bootcamp at the beginning of the year. There I started to learn and be exposed to different languages and technologies on both the front and back-ends. Two of the things that I gained from my bootcamp experience was being connected with like minded individuals and and starting to zero in on what it is I really need to learn to become a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I'm ready for the next step and ready to start a career as a web developer.
    </p>
